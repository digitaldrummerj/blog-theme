My name is Justin James.  I'm a programmer, agile enthusiast, and speaker from Chandler, Arizona.  I work as a developer at Intel but **this blog, its content, and opinions are my own.** I blog about technology, agile practices, code, and the web.  I'm excited about web development, community, sharing knowledge, and agile practices.

I have a passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge with others.  If you would like me to speak at your conference or organization, please [email me](mailto:digitaldrummerj@gmail.com) .  I can cover pretty much any topic you see me blog about but feel free to request just about anything.  

If you've attended one of my sessions, please send me your feedback or suggestions. 

If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.
